<h2>Starting the ICS_211a</h2>
<p>
This program has only one purpose, collection of attendence information at events, i.e. ICS-211 information.
When starting the program the first thing it does is ask for a file in which to store the data.
</p>
<p>
If the file chosen is a new file then the program asks for the Event Information.  Then it organizes
itself to accept barcodes from the reader.  The individual reads are displayed in the application
window with the most recent one first.
</p>
<p>
If the BarCode reader has not been plugged in, a reminder message box will be displayed.  Otherwise, the
program is ready to read barcodes and announces that fact.
</p>
<p>
If the file exists it is assumed to a file created by this program and the information is read into the
internal data structures as if it had never left them.  The progam may be exited and restarted whenever it
is idle (not actually updating the roster).  If the program is restarted with a xxx.211 file, then the contents of that
file is displayed in the main window.
</p>

The M(ember) command starts a dialog box which has two sections, Check-In and Check-Out.  The Check-In
combo (drop-down) box contains all the members information.  The Check-In drop-down list contains all the
members, the Check-Out list contains only those members that have check-in.  Clicking OK adds the members

Preparation of the Spreadsheet Command
</h3>
<p>
Once you are finished with the meeting or the next day or two and the spreadsheet output needs to be
prepared.
The essence is that it will find the first and last record for each attendee.  This information is then
displayed in the main window in the ICS-211 format.  The display is composed of heading information and one line for each attendee.

It will become obvious which members did not check out and the Fix Checkout Command will allow a checkout time to be supplied (see details below).
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/Edit.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Edit People"> Fix Checkout Command</h3>
<p>
Only the entries with missing checkouts or an elapsed time less than a quarter hour are displayed here.
There is a dropdown box with the callsign and name of the attendee,
a Check Out Date and Time edit box, and a Mediian or Average CheckOut time information line.  The idea is that the user pick an attendee from the drop down box and a time or time and date.
</p>
<p>
The Median check out date/time or the average (if there are 2 or fewer attendees) is displayed.  This can
give the user a hint of what to use for a check out time.
</p>
<p>
The data structures are update whenever the time edit box or the drop down list is left.  It does not matter which order things
are done.  For example, a single check out time can be chosen and then each attendee can be selected one at a time to be
updated with that time.  If an attendee is not selected in the dropdown box the spreadsheet entry will not be changed.
</p>
<h3><img src="Images/Excel.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Save As"> Output to a CSV File</h3>
<p>
The write to the spreadsheet input file is done right after a file is chosen.
It will be a comma Separated Value (csv) file including all the elements on display.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/SaveAs.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Save As"> Output Current Screen to a Text File</h3>
<p>
The current screen is written to a text file with a name chosen by appending the nature of the screen to the name of
the 211 file.  There is one glitch with a one for one transfer to the file.  The screen is displayed in Ariel font but
a text file behaves more like a Courier font.  The solution is to increase the tabs by a factor of ~1.3.  Then the columns
will line up in the text file.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/Print.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="Print"> Print</h3>
<p>
It will print a report similar to a paper ICS-211 form.  Use the File/Print Preview Menu command to see

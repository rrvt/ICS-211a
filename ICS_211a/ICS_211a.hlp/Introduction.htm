<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Body" -->
<h2>ICS_211a</h2>
<p>
ICS_211a is an attempt to collect ICS-211 Information from the Members of SJ RACES and Visitors.  Members will be able
to wave their badge in front of a BarCde reader to effect check-in and check-out.  Should they not have their badge
the program allows the members to look up their information in a dialog drop-down list.  For check-out a list of the
attendees is available during check-out time in another drop-down list in the dialog box.
</p>
<p>
The visitors may check-in and out with another dialog box and the information input is available during check-out
in a drop-down list.
</p>
<p>
The most current list of members may be organized by the program from a file prepared by RacesDB.  The data is stored
in the application's roaming folder.
</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<h3>Printer Output</h3>
<p>
The program will print a landscape version of the ICS_211a data in a format similar to the paper form
ICS-211 used by San Jose RACES.  This version of the ICS_211a data may be displayed in the application
window or in the Print Preview Screen.  In addition to the raw data, the attenance time is computed
for each person from the login and logout data and the total attendance time is also computed.  
Both the individual attendance times and the aggragate time are displayed.
</p>

<h3>Excel Spreadsheet CSV File</h3>
<p>
The program upon command will Save a comma separated file suitable for loading into Excel (or other spreadsheet programs).  The attendance time is computed for each entry
where there are two entries in the program using the first and last entries (by time).  The total attendance hours
is computed and displayed prominently on the first line of the spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>There is a provision for correcting absent checkouts during the output phase. Furthermore, the program decides to use either a full date and time or just a time output dependent on the length of the event.</p>
<p>
  Some effort has been made to ensure that data will not be lost.  The data is stored when it is received by the
  program and restarting the program will allow the original data file to be reloaded.</p>
